DDT linked to Alzheimer’s disease

DDT was banned in the US in the 1970s because of its toxic effects in bald eagles. Despite its ban almost 50 years ago, DDT is still detectable in the blood of most Americans. In a new study, researchers have linked the legacy pesticide to an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease, the most common neurodegenerative disease today that affects the elderly more than others.

Researchers at Emory University have developed a method to catalog all small molecules that can be detected in blood. Small molecules (or metabolites) reach the blood from food, drinks, medications, drugs, and from exposure to environmental pollutants. This catalog would serve as the metabolic and environmental equivalent of the genome for any individual. In 2019, the researchers found that in people with Alzheimer’s disease, there was a higher amount of a small molecule that derives from DDT. 

With this lead, their colleagues at Columbia University followed up the biological significance of this finding. They used a microscopic round worm, **Caenorhabditis elegans** (worm), to study how DDT affects a normal worm, and a worm model of Alzheimer’s disease, in which all the neurons are forced to create a toxic form of a protein that is found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. The worm is very well studied, making it a good model to investigate such biological and toxicological questions.

Exposure to DDT made normal worms shorter in length, and reduced their metabolic rate, a function that is controlled by the energy producing mitochondria. DDT also reduced the amount of several amino acids in the worm. But, when the Alzheimer’s disease model was exposed to DDT, all the effects of DDT in normal worms were exaggerated. They were even shorter, with a greater impairment in metabolic rate, with impaired motility, with greatly altered levels of several metabolites, and they even lived shorter lives than the normal worms.  

For the first time, these researchers have documented the effect of DDT on metabolism and the mitochondria in the presence of toxic protein aggregates; however, they state that their study could have benefited from being able to control the amount of the toxic protein in the neurons, and they would have liked to observe the effects of DDT on function into old age. 

Even though DDT has been banned for half a century, it is very stable in the environment and can still be detected in marine life and in humans. Besides, DDT was widely used between the 1930s and 1960s, the years when those aged 70 - 80 years today were in their teens – the population most vulnerable to Alzheimer’s disease. When it comes to persistent chemicals, banning them may not be enough to reduce their toxic effects on life. Regulators should also consider ways to reduce its levels or counter its biological effects.
