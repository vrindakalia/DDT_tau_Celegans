# Egg laying behavior

We determined changes in number of eggs retained in the worm body following the 72-hour DDT exposure period. Day 1 adult worms, 1 per well, were transferred to 96 well plates containing 20\% hypochlorite solution. Dissolution of the worm body and release of eggs was monitored and eggs were counted manually. Data were collected from four trials with 15 worms assessed from each group per trial and analyzed using a Poisson regression model with an interaction term.
