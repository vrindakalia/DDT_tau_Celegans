# Mitochondrial function
Mitochondrial functions was determined using the Seahorse XFe96 extracellular flux analysis which measured the rate of oxygen consumed by a number of worms in a 96 well flux analysis plate. Using the protocol designed by Koopman and colleagues (2016), we measured the rate of oxygen consumed by worms when treated with DDT. 

Using apprpriate mitochondrial toxicants, the seahorse analyzer allows us to measure the performance of the mitochondria at baseline, at maximal capacity, and oxygen consumed through non-mitochondrial respiration. 

Over 18 measurements, the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) is determined, as can be seen in this figure:

The OCR profile provides measures of basal respiration, maximal respiration, spare capacity and non-mitochondrial respiration which can be assesed through these measurements:
