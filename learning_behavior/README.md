# Associative learning 

The short-term associative learning assay was carried out as previously described (Kauffman et al., 2011) with some modifications. The assay relies on an associative memory paradigm where worms are trained by pairing the presence of food with the odor of 10% butanone. Briefly, worms were hypochlorite synced and allowed to grow on DDT or solvent control plates for about 72 hours, until they reached the young adult stage. Worms were collected off plates and washed 3x. After the last wash, the naive attraction toward butanone was assessed. Worms were then starved for an hour, after which the conditioned training was performed to pair the odor with the presence of food. The attraction toward butanone was determined just after conditioning, representing their ability to learn and form an associative memory. To count the number of worms attracted to the butanone spot or the control (95% ethanol) spot, images of the entire assay plates were taken on a Basler GigE camera, and the images were analyzed using a MATLAB algorithm created by the Murphy lab (Kauffman et al., 2011).
