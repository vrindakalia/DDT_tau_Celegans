# Swim behavior

We determined changes in swim behavior as a result of tau protein or DDT using the celeST software package (Restif et al., 2014). Briefly, 3-4 worms at the young adult stage were placed in 60 ul of M9 on a glass slide.  Recordings of swim behavior were made as a series of jpeg images using a chameleon 3 camera ((FLIR) Wilsonville, OR) for 30s at a frame rate of 18 f/s. Data are collected from four-five trials representing different experiments, with a total of 50 -100 worms recorded per group.
